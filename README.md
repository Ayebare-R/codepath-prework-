## FIRST_XCODE_PROJECT! (SCHOOL SELF-INTO APPLICATION)

### App Description

The first x_code_project I've worked on for the Codepath iOS development program. The app offers a user the chance to introduce themselves by inputting their first and last names, school they attend, year they are in, and number of pets they currently own. When the user hits the "Introduce self" button, the app returns an alert page on which the user can see what information they put into the app.
